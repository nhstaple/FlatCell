## Why use git flow? ##

So we can all work on indivudal components in our own `feature/` branches. Then we push to `dev` when we've finished our component.

After we have all finished a stage we create a `release/` branch to get rid of all of the bugs, add documentation, etc. Once that is finished we publish the `release/` branch and the `master` branch gets updated. Nick will make a tag so we can keep track of versions by downloading .zip files.
