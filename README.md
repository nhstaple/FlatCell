# About
## FlatCell
This is a final group project for [ECS 189L Game Programming](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/) taught by Dr. Joshua A. McCoy and
assisted by Arunpreet Sandhu during the Spring 2019 Quarter at University of California, Davis. The project's scope was "Game Jam" 
in size but thought was put into allowing the system to be expanded upon in the future through reusuable `interfaces` and
object `inheritance`. 

This game was inspired by the likes of *Spore* and *Flatland*. How would the world look if the fundamental building blocks of life were
geometry? How would life evolve from the most primative single-cell organism, into complex multi-cell orgnism? How would a 1D `dot`
evolve into a 3D `sphere`?

Taking inspiration from *Planiverse*, a derivative of *Flatland*, we've constructed a simple simulation of geometric evolution in 
a world that's influenced by the player's actions. We've taken the view that the player is a visiter to this 2D world thus they're
the only one to have direct influence over the `canvas`.

The `canvas` is an infinite sheet which all `geo`s reside within. Or, FlatCell's gameworld.
