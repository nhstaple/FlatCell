# ECS189L-Group-Project
Group members- Megan Brown, Brian Coe, David Lee, Kyle Catapusan, Nick Stapleton

## About
### FlatCell
This is a final group project for [ECS 189L Game Programming](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/) taught by Dr. Joshua A. McCoy and
assisted by Arunpreet Sandhu during the Spring 2019 Quarter at University of California, Davis. The project's scope was "Game Jam" 
in size but thought was put into allowing the system to be expanded upon in the future through reusuable `interfaces` and
object `inheritance`. 

### The Team
Inlcude our bios so Brian can include them in the press kit and remove them.

### Megan
#### Roles- Animation/Visuals, Audio

* As the team's master of visuals, you are responsible for implementing the basic animation scripts used by objects in your game. You are also tasked with setting the visual style and are the primary person responsible for finding the art assets to use in your game. You will document the animation systems used, a guide to the visual style of your game, and to document the sources and licenses of the art assets used in your game.
* You are responsible for defining the game's sound style, procuring audio assets, and implementing scripts for adding sound to your game. You will document the sound style, the sources/licenses for all audio assets, and the implementation of your audio system.

### Brian
#### Roles - Movement/Physics, Press Kit and Trailer
#### Graduating

* This role is responsible for implementing movement within your game. You will have the choice of managing movement by directly translating objects in your game or leveraging Unity's physics system. It is your task to establish and document the basic conventions of movement in your game world (e.g. how gravity works, friction coefficients, animation curve value conventions, etc.). While you are responsible for documentation and making sure all objects in the game observe your conventions, other team members can implement objects and conventions that use your conventions.
* You are responsible for creating a press kit for your game that includes screenshots and a 1-minute trailer. You should document the choices you made in the press kit and the goals of your trailer in the design document.

### David
#### Roles - UI, Game Feel

* In this role, you are responsible for the user interface elements of the game. This typically includes the contents of the heads up display or HUD. This traditionally comprises gameplay status information such as player character health, score, resources like magic points or gold, and time-keepers. This is also responsible for menu and credit screens. You are responsible for documenting the various UI elements you implement and how they interact with the changing state of the game.
* In this role, you are responsible for using what we learned in class about game feel to enhance your game's playability. You will document what you added to and how you tweaked your game to improve its game feel.

### Kyle
#### Roles - Input, Gameplay Testing
#### Graduating

* In this role, you will be responsible for managing the input methods for your game. You should design your game to be used with either keyboard and mouse or a game controller. If you would like to excel in this role, you can add additional input control schemes for mobile devices. You will document what the inputs are and how they affect each of the game modes (e.g. menu, main gameplay, inventory screens, credits, etc.) and how they interact with the game work and UI/HUD.
* As the gameplay tester, you are responsible for having 10 non-team members playtest your game. You fill out the Observation and Playtester Comments form for each of your play testers and describe the results in the design document (after you share the results with your tea, of course!).

### Nick
#### Roles- Game Logic, Narrative Design.
#### Expected Summer 2020

* Major: Computer Science
* Minor: Moosic üêÆ
* Favorite fact: [U.S.A. mapped onto the moon.](https://imgur.com/yl7v7Bd)
* In most projects, this will be the most complicated role as it is a point of integration for nearly all of the gameplay systems. Traditionally, most of the game logic is placed in a game manager singleton and is referenced as needed by other scripts. It is the job of your team's game logician to manage the various game states (i.e. current level, main menu, main gameplay mode) and data (i.e. time remaining, quest completion status, references to all active enemies and items). You will document what game states and game data you managed and what design patterns you used to complete your task. Charts are a great way to visually explain how parts of your game logic interact with the other gameplay systems.
* You are responsible for designing and embedding the story of your game into the gameplay experience. While your team may collective decide on the story, you will make it present in the game. You will document how the narrative is present in the game via assets, gameplay systems, and gameplay.
