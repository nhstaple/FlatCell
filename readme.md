# About FlatCell
This game was inspired by the likes of [**_Spore_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game)) and [**_Flatland_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland). How would the world look if the fundamental building blocks of life were geometry? How would life evolve from the most primative single-cell organism, into complex multi-cell orgnism? How would a 1D dot evolve into a 3D sphere?

Taking inspiration from [**_Planiverse_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planiverse), a derivative of **_Flatland_**, we've constructed a simple simulation of geometric evolution in a world that's influenced by the player's actions. We've taken the view that the player is a visiter to this 2D world thus they're the only one to have direct influence over the canvas.

The canvas is an infinite sheet which all geos reside within. Or, **_FlatCell_**'s game world.
