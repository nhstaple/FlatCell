# Flat Cell Press Kit

# About
## FlatCell
This game was inspired by the likes of *Spore* and *Flatland*. How would the world look if the fundamental building blocks of life were
geometry? How would life evolve from the most primative single-cell organism, into complex multi-cell orgnism? How would a 1D `dot`
evolve into a 3D `sphere`?

Taking inspiration from *Planiverse*, a derivative of *Flatland*, we've constructed a simple simulation of geometric evolution in 
a world that's influenced by the player's actions. We've taken the view that the player is a visiter to this 2D world thus they're
the only one to have direct influence over the `canvas`.

The `canvas` is an infinite sheet which all `geo`s reside within. Or, FlatCell's gameworld.
